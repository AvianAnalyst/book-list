# Reading List
Welcome! This is a terminal based tool to help you keep up on your reading list.

## Setup
Setup is easy! Make sure you have Pip, Python3, and Pipenv installed. Then run:
```shell script
$ pipenv shell
```
This will create your virtual environment, and sync all your dependencies. Then it will automatically launch your shell 
in a subshell. Use exit to leave it! 

#### Optional
If you have a Google Books API key you want to use, you can add it to a .env file with KEY as the key, and it will be
sourced. It, however, isn't necessary, and offers no extra utility.

## Usage
Usage is easy, launch it with either `pipenv run python main.py` or if you're in the shell `python main.py `. You 
should be able to get started from here!
